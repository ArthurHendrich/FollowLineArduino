Arduino Follow Line

This program will use 4 sensors located on the front of the robot (you can change the position)
It will identify a white line, which it will follow.

It must have a black background around the white line for better sensor operation.
You can and should change the values ​​of the speeds and perhaps the position
of the sensors as your program needs.


Two variables have been declared for engine speeds.
 According to the curve you are going to make, to the left or right,
one of the engine speeds will be higher than the other precisely to compensate for the weight.
